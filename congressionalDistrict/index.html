<!-- You're going to create an HTML component to represent a political candidate. Specifically, the representative of your Congressional
  district. Visit the GovTrack site link below, enter in your home address, and you'll find basic information about your representative.
  GovTrack - Congressional District Map (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map)
  
  <!- In your HTML, create an article tag that will serve as your main representative component. -->
  <!-- In this section create elements for the representative's image, name, district info, and political affiliation. -->
  <!-- Give the element a unique identifier. In this component, create a sub-component for basic information using the section tag. -->
  <!-- Beneath the basic information, you will create a sub-component, using a section tag, to list any committees the candidate is serving on. -->
  
  <!-- The last component will hold links to any legislation that your representative has enacted.  -->
<!-- Make sure you use good BEM-style class names for each element in your components. Put a comment above each component explaining what it is. -->
